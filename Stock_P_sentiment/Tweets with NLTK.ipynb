When you have registered your API keys, you can store them in a file on your computer, and then use them whenever you want. We explain what's involved in the section [First Steps](#first_steps).\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"If you have already obtained Twitter API keys as part of some earlier project, [storing your keys](#store_keys) explains how to save them to a file that NLTK will be able to find.

As long as you save your registration information correctly, you should only need to do this once, since the information should work for any NLTK code that you write. You will need to have a Twitter account before you can register. Twitter also insists that [you add a mobile phone number to your Twitter profile](https://support.twitter.com/articles/110250-adding-your-mobile-number-to-your-account-via-web) before you will be allowed to register an application.\\n\",\n",

    "    \"\\n\",\n",

    "    \"<img src=\\\"images/twitter_app4.png\\\" width=\\\"650px\\\">\\n\",\n",

    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"1. Create a folder named `twitter-files` in your home directory. Within this folder, use a text editor to create a new file called `credentials.txt`. Make sure that this file is just a plain text file. In it, you should create which you should store in a text file with the following structure:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"```\\n\",\n",
    "    \"app_key=YOUR CONSUMER KEY  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"app_secret=YOUR CONSUMER SECRET  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"oauth_token=YOUR ACCESS TOKEN  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"oauth_token_secret=YOUR ACCESS TOKEN SECRET\\n\",\n",

    "    \"Type the part up to and includinge the '=' symbol exactly as shown. The values on the right-hand side of the '=' &mdash; that is, everything in caps &mdash; should be cut-and-pasted from the relevant API key information shown on the Twitter **Keys and Access Tokens**. Save the file and that's it.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"2. It's going to be important for NLTK programs to know where you have stored your\\n\",\n",
    "    \"   credentials. We'll assume that this folder is called `twitter-files`, but you can call it      anything you like. We will also assume that this folder is where you save any files            containing tweets that you collect. Once you have decided on the name and location of this \\n\",\n",
    "    \"   folder, you will need to set the `TWITTER` environment variable to this value. \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"   On a Unix-like system (including MacOS), you will set the variable something like this:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"   ```bash\\n\",\n",
    "    \"   export TWITTER=\\\"/path/to/your/twitter-files\\\"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"   ```\\n\",\n",
    "    \"   Rather than having to give this command each time you start a new session, it's advisable      to add it to your shell's configuration file, e.g. to `.bashrc`.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"   On a Windows machine, right click on “My Computer” then select `Properties > Advanced >        Environment Variables > User Variables > New...` \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"   One important thing to remember is that you need to keep your `credentials.txt` file          private. So do **not** share your `twitter-files` folder with anyone else, and do **not**      upload it to a public repository such as GitHub.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
