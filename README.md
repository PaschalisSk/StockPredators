# Stock Prediction

Team based project for the Machine Learning Practical course during my AI
MSc in the University of Edinburgh (2018/19). The team included [@mikeperple](https://github.com/mikeperple)
and [@HaydnCCI](https://github.com/HaydnCCI). 
It was awarded a grade of 67/100 (B).

## Abstract

Financial time series prediction is a topic that
has gained a lot of attention due to large potential profits. In order to approach this problem,
non linear methods were applied. Among others, backpropagation networks and LSTMs are
widely used for stock market prices prediction
since they can capture non-linearities and both
were used as baselines. Our idea is to investigate
whether adding information about a particular
stock such as headlines and Google Trends would
improve the performance of our initial baseline.
Our results indicate that in the best case scenario,
the results are similar.
